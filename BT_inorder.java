/* 	Binary Tree Inorder Traversal */
/*	Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

	For example: Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
		1
	    \
	     2
	    /
	   3
	return [1,3,2].
	Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
*/

// Questions about traversal is often solved by recursion and stack+iterative.
// Another solution is Morris Traversal.
// 1. Iterative way (stack).   Time: O(n), Space: O(n).
// 2. Recursive solution.      Time: O(n), Space: O(n).
// 3. Threaded tree (Morris).  Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
